## Planning

## Technical Requirements

## Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Express
* Sequelize
* postgres
* HTML/CSS

# Approach Taken
* Start the progress by buiding the basic HTML mockup!
* 


# Issues
* Learning jquery
* Originally I had a combination of vanilla javascript and Jquery on my page and it was getting hard to integrate it so I went with jquery to simpilify the process!
* Matching and comparing arrays are hard, my design was to originally pull a word, split the string into just characters, dynamically generate the letters based on the character array and so Lauren only has those letters to chose from.  YEA... that didn't work which led to me hardcoding the card positions
* The winning condition is not complete, I can still drag cards

# Unsolved Problems


# Next Steps
* Add music
* Fix winning condition
* Add compare array function and figure out how to dynamically display divs based on the word
* add roads
* additional styling
